# Birth-Data-Analysis

Over the course of one month, myself and two others gathered data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danbraswell/temporary-us-births/code) to determine conclusions for **two essential questions:**

1. How does maternal educational attainment influence birth outcomes, such as birth weight and maternal age, across different states and years in the U.S.?

2. Are mothers with lower levels of education more likely to have multiple children compared to those with higher educational attainment?

## Conclusions

1. **Maternal education is inversely related to fertility rates:** Women with high school or some college education have more children, while those with advanced degrees tend to delay childbirth and have fewer births overall.

2. **Higher education correlates with better birth outcomes:** Educated mothers are more likely to have healthier babies, likely due to improved prenatal care access, health knowledge, and economic resources.

3. **Geographic disparities reflect educational and reproductive trends:** Northeastern and Western states show more college-educated mothers and later childbearing compared to the South, indicating regional inequality in maternal resources and planning.

4. **Policy implications point to education as a lever for better outcomes:** The findings support targeting interventions by region and education level, and call for further study into related factors like paternal education and local support systems.
