# Birth-Data-Analysis

Over the course of one month, myself and two others gathered data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danbraswell/temporary-us-births/code) to determine conclusions for **two essential questions:**

1. How does maternal educational attainment influence birth outcomes, such as birth weight and maternal age, across different states and years in the U.S.?

2. Are mothers with lower levels of education more likely to have multiple children compared to those with higher educational attainment?

## Conclusions

This comprehensive analysis of U.S. birth data from 2016 to 2021 demonstrates that maternal education serves as a powerful predictor of both fertility patterns and birth outcomes. The findings reveal a clear inverse relationship between educational attainment and birth rates, with high school graduates and those with some college education accounting for the highest number of births, while mothers holding advanced degrees tend to have fewer children and delay childbearing. Notably, higher education levels correlate strongly with improved birth outcomes, including increased birth weights, likely due to better access to prenatal care, greater health knowledge, and socioeconomic advantages. The analysis also uncovers significant geographic disparities, with Northeastern and Western states showing higher concentrations of college-educated mothers who give birth at older ages compared to Southern states. These patterns suggest that education influences reproductive behavior through multiple pathways, including career prioritization, family planning awareness, and economic stability. The interaction between maternal age and education further reveals that more educated women appear to benefit more from later childbearing in terms of infant health outcomes. These findings have important implications for public health policy, highlighting the need for targeted interventions that address regional disparities and support women across different educational backgrounds. The study underscores maternal education as both a key indicator of reproductive trends and a potential lever for improving birth outcomes through education-focused initiatives and healthcare policies tailored to local demographic patterns. Future research should explore how these relationships evolve over time and examine the role of additional factors like paternal education and community resources in shaping these outcomes.
