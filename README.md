# Birth-Data-Analysis

Over the course of one month, myself and two others gathered data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danbraswell/temporary-us-births/code) to determine conclusions for **two essential questions:**

1. How does maternal educational attainment influence birth outcomes, such as birth weight and maternal age, across different states and years in the U.S.?

2. Are mothers with lower levels of education more likely to have multiple children compared to those with higher educational attainment?

## Conclusions

1. Analysis of U.S. birth data (2016-2021) demonstrates that maternal education strongly predicts fertility patterns and birth outcomes, revealing an inverse relationship between educational attainment and birth rates

2. Higher education levels correlate with improved birth outcomes, such as increased birth weights (e.g., Master's degree mothers deliver babies 78g heavier than baseline ), likely due to better access to prenatal care, health knowledge, and socioeconomic advantages.

3. Significant geographic disparities exist, with Northeastern and Western states showing higher concentrations of college-educated mothers giving birth at older ages compared to Southern states

4. These findings have important implications for public health policy, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to address regional disparities and support women across diverse educational backgrounds.
